### Future recommendations
---
######  
While this is useful for volunteers to look up their information, additional value could be gained by creating options to filter for the needs of additional use cases:  
     1. The customer wants to filter for prevalent species.  
     2. Analyze data to ascertain if there is any correlation between wash frequency and another variable...or two...or more (species variety, population size, etc.).  
There are many more answers to tease out of this data set.
